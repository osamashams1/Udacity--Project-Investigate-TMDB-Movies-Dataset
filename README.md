Udacity--Project-Investigate-TMDB-Movies-Dataset
Project Overview
In this project, we have to analyze a dataset and then communicate our findings about it. We will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make your analysis easier.

You will need an installation of Python, plus the following libraries:

pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
csv

In this project, we have to go through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together. Using the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, which make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier!

After completing the project, I have learned following :

Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code
